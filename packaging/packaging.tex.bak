\chapter{Linux distribution}

In the Linux world two distrubtions beccame widely famous, mostly because of the package distribution systems they implemented: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The \href{https://www.redhat.com}{Red Hat Linux} distribution that created and maintain the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM\_Package\_Manager}{RPM Package-Manager} "Red Hat Package Manager" system, that handles the installation/removal of \href{RPM "Red Hat Packages"}, files with the \bftt{.rpm} extension.
\item The \href{https://www.debian.org}{Debian Linux} distribution that created and maintain the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg}{dpkg} package management system, that handles the installation/removal of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb\_(file\_format)}{DEB "Debian Packages"}, files with \bftt{{.deb}} extension.
\end{itemize}
In 2023 there are thousands of Linux distributions, most of them are either Red Hat based and integrate the RPM Package-Manager, or, Debian based and integrate the dpkg package management system. \\
Integrating the package management systems of both Red Hat and Debian distributions is the most natural way to efficiently distribute your program to the entire open source / Linux community. \\
In the next sections I will review the requirements to achieve it providing that you already built a proper GNU tarball, or for that matter that you are already using any other build system.
