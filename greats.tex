\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

You are about to read a document I decided to write after packaging my own software \href{https://atomes.ipcms.fr}{atomes} for the \href{https://fedoraproject.org}{Fedora} and \href{https://www.debian.org}{Debian} Linux distributions. 
I wanted to put together the results of theses experiences so that it could help others to take advantage of the fantastic opportunities of the open source communities. \\[0.25cm]
But the fact is that I am neither a specialist of building systems, git, GitHub, GitLab, RPM or even Debian packaging. 
I merely have now a broad perspective of the whole system. \\[0.25cm]
I had help, to say the least, along the way. \\[0.25cm]
Help when I pushed open the doors of the Fedora and the Debian communities where I got lucky to find people who supported \href{https://atomes.ipcms.fr}{atomes}, 
and took the time to teach me to make it happen ... not only that but they also accepted to proof read this document afterwards, crazy ... thank you so, so, very much: 
\begin{itemize}
\item My \href{https://fedoraproject.org}{Fedora} mentor: {\bf{Alexander Ploumistos}}
\item My \href{https://www.debian.org}{Debian} mentor: {\bf{Pierre Gruet}}
\end{itemize}
I also have to thank Sylvain Thery, a colleague and Git specialist, who kindly destroyed the first version of the Git chapter of this manual.
